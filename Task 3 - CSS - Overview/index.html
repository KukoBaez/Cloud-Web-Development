<p id="description">Cats originated from wildcats known as Felis silvestris lybica, native to the Fertile Crescent in the Near East. Their domestication began around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago during the Neolithic period, coinciding with the advent of agriculture. Early humans stored grain, which attracted rodents, and wildcats likely began living near human settlements to prey on these pests. Over time, a symbiotic relationship developed, and cats became domesticated
